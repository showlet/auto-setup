# Quick devbox
WIP, the idea is to automate the build process of a non-dockerised ubundu 16.04 with xfce4 desktop box to be a complete dev environment ready for work. It (mostly will) install ans set wallpapers, set xfce panel configs, install deps, install fonts, configure vscode & more. This is mostly for my chromebook wich has ubuntu chrooted with chromeOS, wich has issues with docker.

### to run it
setup.sh chmods the whole scripts folder then runs every script one by one.
```Shell
sh setup.sh
```

Otherwise, you can run every script independently in the `scripts/` folder
